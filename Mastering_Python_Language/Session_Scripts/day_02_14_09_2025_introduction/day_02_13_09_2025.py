# ============================================
# Hello World Program in Python
# ============================================
# The first program usually written in any language is "Hello, World!"
# This helps to verify that the programming environment is working properly.
# print("Hello, World!")


# ============================================
# Python Syntax
# ============================================
# Python uses indentation (spaces or tabs) to define code blocks instead of braces {}.
# Example: A simple if statement with correct indentation  
# age = 18
# if age >= 18:
#     print("You are an adult.")


# ============================================
# Python Keywords
# ============================================
# Keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meaning.
# You cannot use them as variable names.
# Examples: if, else, while, for, def, class, True, False, None, etc.
# Let's demonstrate using a few:
# for number in range(3):   # 'for' and 'in' are keywords
#     print("Number:", number)


# ============================================
# Python Literals
# ============================================
# Literals are fixed values that represent data.
# Common types of literals:
# - String: "Hello"
# - Integer: 10 
# - Float: 3.14
# - Boolean: True, False
# - None: represents no value
# string_literal = "Python"
# multiple_lines = """This is line 1
# This is line 2
# """
# integer_literal = 42
# float_literal = 3.14
# boolean_literal = True
# none_literal = None
# print(string_literal, multiple_lines, integer_literal, float_literal, boolean_literal, none_literal)


# ============================================
# Python Operators
# ============================================
# Operators perform operations on variables and values.
# Types of operators include:
# 1. Arithmetic (+, -, *, /, %)
# 2. Comparison (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
# 3. Logical (and, or, not)
# Example:
# a = 10
# b = 3
# print("Addition:", a + b)        # Arithmetic
# print("Sub:", a-b)
# print("Mul:", a*b)
# print(a/b)
# print(a%b)
# print("Is a > b?", a > b)        # Comparison
# print(a<b)
# print("Logical AND:", (a > 5 and b < 1))  # Logical
# print("Logical AND:", (a > 5 or b < 1))  # Logical


# ============================================
# Python Comments
# ============================================
# Comments are used to explain code and make it easier to understand.
# Single-line comments start with '#'.
# Multi-line comments can be written using triple quotes (''' or """).

# print("Hello")

# This is a single-line comment
"""
This is a
multi-line comment
used to describe code blocks in detail.
"""
# print("Comments are ignored by Python interpreter.")
